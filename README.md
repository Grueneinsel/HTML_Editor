# Arbonotate

> **Arbonotate** = *Arbor* (Latin: tree) + *annotate* — a browser-based workbench for annotating and comparing dependency trees.

Browser-based tool for comparing and annotating dependency trees in CoNLL-U files.
Runs entirely locally without a server — simply open `index.html` in your browser.

---

## Quick Start

1. Open `index.html` in your browser — last session is loaded automatically
2. Load at least two `.conllu` files — or click **"Load demo"**
3. Select a sentence → tree view and comparison table appear automatically
4. Click Gold cells or use keyboard shortcuts to edit annotations
5. Mark a finished sentence with **"✓ Confirm"** (or `Space`)
6. **💾 Save session** — save your progress as JSON at any time and resume later

---

## Projects

The tool supports multiple **projects** simultaneously — each with its own files, annotations, and undo history.

### Project Tab Bar

The tab bar appears directly below the header. Each tab has:

| Button | Function |
|---|---|
| **◀ / ▶** | Reorder projects |
| **✎** | Rename project |
| **×** | Delete project (only when more than one project exists) |
| **+** (far right) | Create a new empty project |

Click a tab to switch to that project. State (files, sentence position, undo stack) is automatically saved and restored on switch.

### Keyboard Shortcuts for Projects

| Key | Function |
|---|---|
| `[` | Previous project |
| `]` | Next project |

### Project Lock

Each project can be **locked** or **unlocked** (button in section 1, below the file list):

| State | Symbol | Behaviour |
|-------|--------|-----------|
| Locked | 🔒 | Read-only: no editing via table, popup, or tree |
| Unlocked | 🔓 | All editing features active; HEAD/DEPREL columns appear |

The state is saved with the session and restored on load.

### Automatic Assignment on Load

When files with **different sentence counts** are loaded, the tool assigns them to projects automatically:

1. **Own project** (active) — if empty or matching sentence count
2. **Other existing project** — with matching sentence count
3. **Other empty project** — as a last resort
4. **Create new project** — only if no match found

A brief notification appears when a new project is created automatically.

---

## 1) Load Files

| Action | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **"Add files"** | Opens the file dialog; `.conllu`, `.conll`, `.txt` and `.json` files selectable |
| **"📤 Upload tagset"** | Also opens the file dialog — accepts all file types |
| **"📂 Load session"** | Also opens the file dialog — accepts all file types |
| **Drag & Drop** | Drop files directly onto the page — all types are recognised |
| **"Load demo"** | Three pre-built example files covering all comparison cases |
| **"Reset"** | Reset all files and annotations |

All upload paths (buttons and drag & drop) detect the file type automatically:

| Extension | Detected type | Action |
|-----------|---------------|--------|
| `.conllu`, `.conll`, `.txt` | CoNLL-U file | Load as annotator file |
| `.json` with `version` + `docs`/`projects` | Session | Import session |
| `.json` (everything else) | Tagset | Load as new tagset |

### Per-File Actions

Each loaded file has the following buttons:

| Button | Function |
|---|---|
| **⬇ Download** | Download file as CoNLL-U (original content) |
| **Project dropdown** | Move file to another project; **＋ New project …** creates one and moves the file immediately |
| **▲ / ▼** | Change order within the project |
| **Remove** | Remove file from the project |

### Text Consistency Warning

If two files have different tokens at the same sentence index:
- **⚠️ badge** next to the filename
- Orange **warning banner** below the file list

---

## 2) Select Sentence

### Dropdown

Each option shows:
- Sentence number and star `★` if confirmed
- Token count
- Number of differences (`· N diffs`) or a checkmark (`· ✓`) if fully matching

**Colours in the dropdown:**

| Colour | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| Green | No differences |
| Red | At least one difference |
| Gold | Sentence confirmed (`★`) |

The **dropdown border** reflects the status of the current sentence (green / red / gold).

### Sentence Text

The sentence text is rendered as clickable tokens. Clicking a word:
- Jumps to the corresponding row in the comparison table
- Highlights the token in the sentence text (blue outline)
- Works in reverse too: keyboard navigation (↑/↓) highlights the active word in the sentence text

### Sentence Map

Below the sentence text, a row of small **coloured dots** appears — one per sentence:

| Colour | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| Dark green | No diff |
| Dark red | Has diffs |
| Gold | Confirmed |
| Blue outline | Currently selected sentence |

Click a dot to jump directly to that sentence.

### Confirm Gold

Use **"✓ Confirm"** (or `Space`) to mark the current sentence as finished.
Confirmed sentences are coloured gold (dropdown, sentence map, sentence text border, button).
Pressing again removes the confirmation.

### Note per Sentence

Below the sentence text there is a **note field** — free text, saved per sentence and exported with the session.

### Copy CoNLL-U

The **"Copy CoNLL-U" button** (or key `c`) copies the Gold annotation of the current sentence as CoNLL-U to the clipboard.

---

## 3) Tree View

Shows the current sentence as dependency trees. For each loaded file a diff tree against the Gold annotation is displayed.

### Legend

| Symbol/Colour | Meaning |
|---|---|
| ✅ green | Edge identical to Gold |
| ⚠️ yellow | Same HEAD but different DEPREL / label columns (`🅶X\|🅵Y`) |
| 🅶 gold | Edge only in Gold |
| 🅵 blue | Edge only in this file |
| 🌱 | Subtree root |

Differences in label columns (e.g. UPOS/XPOS) are annotated as `[COLUMN:🅶X\|🅵Y]`.

### Interaction

- **Click a line** → jumps to the corresponding row in the comparison table
- **"→ Gold" button** at each 🌱 line → adopts the entire subtree as the Gold annotation

### Interactive Arc Diagram (Gold view)

The Gold arc diagram is directly editable:

| Action | Function |
|--------|---------|
| **Drag a token** (drag & drop) | Draw a new arc from token to token → sets new HEAD |
| **Deprel popup** | Appears automatically after dragging — or by clicking an arc label |
| **× button** (hover over arc) | Deletes the arc (resets to root) |
| **Click a token** (no drag) | Jumps to the corresponding table row |

**Cycle detection:** If a new arc would create a cycle, the target flashes red and the assignment is rejected.

**Arc colours** match the legend (green = matches Gold, yellow = DEPREL diff, gold = Gold only, blue = file only).

---

## 4) Comparison Table

### Columns

| Column | Content |
|--------|---------|
| **ID** | Token ID |
| **FORM** | Word form |
| **Label columns** | One column per configured label category (default: UPOS, XPOS); yellow border when files differ |
| **GOLD** | Current Gold annotation (`HEAD / DEPREL`); badge `C` = custom, `D1`/`D2`/… = file; label values shown below |
| **File columns** | Each file's annotation; green = matches Gold, red = differs |

In file columns, HEAD/DEPREL and all label columns are highlighted individually — differing fields appear **red** (`.fDiff`).

### Gold Selection

- **Click a file cell** → selects that file as the Gold source for this token (badge `D1`, `D2`, …)
- If a custom value is set, custom values always take precedence; file cells are then greyed out

### Gold Popup (Edit)

**Click a Gold cell** to open an edit popup:

| Field | Input |
|-------|-------|
| HEAD | Dropdown of all tokens in the current sentence |
| DEPREL (+ further dep layers) | Dropdown(s) from the tagset configuration |
| Label columns | One dropdown or free-text field per configured label category |

The number of fields adapts automatically to the loaded tagset configuration (any number of label columns and dependency layers supported).

Changes are saved immediately as a custom entry. **"Reset"** removes the custom entry for this token.

**Keyboard in popup:** `Tab`/`Shift+Tab` switch fields · `Enter` closes · `r` reset · `Esc` close

### Custom Annotation

- **"Custom from [file]" buttons** copy all values of the chosen file as a custom starting point
- **"Clear custom sentence"** removes all custom entries for the current sentence (with confirmation)
- Once a custom value is set, that token is treated as Gold (`C` badge)

### Show/Hide Columns

Use the **column toggle bar** to show or hide individual file columns.

---

## 5) CoNLL-U

Section 5 shows and edits the CoNLL-U data for the current sentence. Its behaviour depends on the **edit mode** (lock in section 1):

### Read-only mode (locked 🔒)

- **Gold table** shows all tokens with current Gold annotations (HEAD, DEPREL, UPOS, XPOS) — read-only
- Rows with active custom overrides are highlighted

### Edit mode (unlocked 🔓)

- **Gold table** (editable): adjust HEAD, DEPREL, UPOS, and XPOS directly — changes are saved immediately as custom values
- **Tab "📝 Structured Editor"**: all CoNLL-U fields of each file as a structured table; add/delete rows, edit values directly
- **Tab "Raw text"**: full CoNLL-U text per file as a textarea; grows automatically with content
  - Edit the text → **"✓ Apply"** transfers changes to all other views
  - **"✕ Reset"** discards changes and restores the last saved state

The section title switches automatically between **"5) CoNLL-U"** (read-only) and **"5) Edit CoNLL-U"** (edit mode).

---

## 6) Export

### Individual File

The **⬇ button** next to each file downloads the original file content as `.conllu`.

### Active Project

| Button | Content |
|--------|---------|
| **Download Gold CoNLL-U** | All sentences of the active project with current Gold annotations (HEAD, DEPREL, UPOS, XPOS); LEMMA/FEATS/DEPS/MISC from source file |
| **Download tree view (all sentences)** | All sentences as plain-text trees with Gold tree and diff trees per file |

### All Projects

| Button | Content |
|--------|---------|
| **Download all projects CoNLL-U** | Exports Gold CoNLL-U for each project as a separate file (`gold_ProjectName.conllu`) |
| **Download all projects tree view** | Exports tree views for each project as a separate file |

Keyboard shortcuts: `e` → CoNLL-U · `E` → tree view · `c` → copy current sentence to clipboard

### Session Export / Import

The **session mechanism** saves the complete working state of all projects:

- All projects with names, files, and annotations
- Custom annotations and Gold selection
- Confirmed sentences and notes
- Full undo/redo history per project
- Label configuration (`labels.js`)

| Action | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **💾 Save session** | Exports everything as a `.json` file |
| **📂 Load session** | Imports a saved session file |
| **Drag & Drop** | Drop a `.json` file onto the page → automatically recognised as a session |

The session format is versioned (`version: 2`) and human-readable JSON.

### Autosave

The working state is automatically saved to the browser's LocalStorage every **30 seconds**. On the next page load, the last state is **restored automatically and silently** — no prompt.

---

## Undo / Redo

All annotation changes (file selection, custom popup, confirm, subtree adoption) can be undone. Each project has its own undo stack.

| Action | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **↩ Undo** / `Ctrl+Z` | Undo last change |
| **↪ Redo** / `Ctrl+Y` | Redo undone change |

The history is saved with the session (up to 80 steps per project).

---

## Guided Tour

The **🎓 Guided Tour** button in the top-right corner starts an interactive introduction to all features.

- The tour automatically opens the English example in a **temporary project** — your own data is completely untouched
- A spotlight and tooltip walk you through all 16 steps: projects, files, sentence navigation, tree view, comparison table, gold annotation, edit mode, CoNLL-U editor, and export
- Exit with **"Skip tour"**, `Esc`, or the "Done" button — the tour project is removed automatically

---

---

## Multiple Languages

The interface supports **German** and **English** — switchable via the flag buttons in the top right. The chosen language is stored in the browser (`localStorage`).

### Adding More Languages

1. Create a new file `lang/xx.js` (following the pattern of `lang/en.js`):

```javascript
window.LANG_XX = {
  'sec.files':   '...',
  // translate all keys from lang/en.js
};
```

2. Include it in `index.html` (before `js/i18n.js`):

```html
<script src="lang/xx.js"></script>
```

3. Add a flag button:

```html
<button class="langBtn" data-lang="xx" onclick="setLang('xx')" title="...">🏳️</button>
```

Or register dynamically at runtime:

```javascript
registerLang('xx', window.LANG_XX);
```

---

## labels.js

`labels.js` in the same folder as `index.html` defines the dropdown contents.

### Classic format (backward compatible)

```javascript
const LABELS = {
  "Core arguments": ["nsubj", "obj", "iobj", ...],
  "Non-core dependents": ["obl", "advmod", ...],
  // ...
  "__upos__": ["ADJ", "ADP", "ADV", "AUX", ...],
  "__xpos__": ["ADJA", "ADJD", "NN", "NE", ...],
  "__upos_name__": "UPOS",   // optional display name
  "__xpos_name__": "XPOS",
};
```

| Key | Description |
|-----|-------------|
| Any string | Grouped section in the DEPREL dropdown |
| `__upos__` | Options for the UPOS field (empty → free-text input) |
| `__xpos__` | Options for the XPOS field (empty → free-text input) |
| `__upos_name__` | Display name for the UPOS column |
| `__xpos_name__` | Display name for the XPOS column |

### Extended format — arbitrary number of label and dependency columns

Use `__cols__` and `__dep_cols__` to define any number of columns:

```json
{
  "__cols__": [
    { "key": "upos",    "name": "UPOS",       "values": ["ADJ", "NOUN", "VERB"] },
    { "key": "xpos",    "name": "XPOS",       "values": ["ADJA", "NN", "VVFIN"] },
    { "key": "entity",  "name": "Entity",     "values": ["PER", "ORG", "LOC", "O"] },
    { "key": "animacy", "name": "Animacy",    "values": ["Anim", "Inan"] }
  ],
  "__dep_cols__": [
    {
      "key": "ud",
      "name": "UD DepRel",
      "groups": {
        "Core arguments": ["nsubj", "obj", "iobj"],
        "Other":          ["punct", "root", "dep"]
      }
    },
    {
      "key": "srl",
      "name": "SRL",
      "groups": {
        "Arguments": ["ARG0", "ARG1", "ARG2", "ARGM"]
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

| Key | Description |
|-----|-------------|
| `__cols__` | Array of label columns; `key` = internal field name, `name` = display name, `values` = dropdown options |
| `__dep_cols__` | Array of dependency annotation layers; first layer = primary HEAD/DEPREL fields; additional layers get their own HEAD and DEPREL dropdowns in the popup |

**CoNLL-U export:** `__cols__[0]` → UPOS column, `__cols__[1]` → XPOS column, further columns → MISC as `key=value`.

Labels are saved with the session and restored on load.

---

## Upload / Download Tagset

The tagset (label and dependency configuration) can be swapped at runtime — without restarting.

### Upload

1. Click **"📤 Upload tagset"**
2. Select a JSON file (classic or extended format)
3. The table, popups, and dropdowns update immediately

### Download

Click **"📥 Download tagset"** to export the current configuration as `tagset.json` — including any manually loaded customisations.

The downloaded JSON can be edited directly and re-uploaded.

---

## Help Modal

The **`?` button** in the top right (or press `?`) opens this documentation directly in the browser.

The help is loaded from `generated/readme_content.js` — a pre-built JS bundle:

```bash
python make_readme_js.py
```

This script reads `README.md` (English, primary) and `README.de.md` (German) and writes `generated/readme_content.js`. Run it once after editing either README, then reload the page.

## Demo Data (`testdata/`)

The six example directories together cover all tool features:

| Directory | Language | Annotators | Notable Features |
|---|---|---|---|
| `ner/` | German | 2 | **Three label columns** (UPOS + XPOS + NER-BIO); `__cols__` with 3 entries |
| `srl/` | German | 2 | **Two dep layers** (UD DepRel + Semantic Role); `__dep_cols__` with 2 entries |
| `custom/` | German | 2 | **Fully custom schema**: 3 label columns (word class / animacy / sentiment) + simplified syntax |
| `morph/` | German | 2 | **Morphology**: Genus/Kasus as label columns; topological field as dep layer |
| `de_ud/` | German | **3** | **Multi-Word Token** (`im` = `in` + `dem`); UPOS + STTS; 3 annotators with typical disagreements |
| `en_ud/` | English | 2 | **Empty Node** (VP-ellipsis / gapping); UPOS + PTB POS; English sentences |

### Feature Overview

| Feature | Where demonstrated |
|---|---|
| Multiple annotators (≥ 3) | `de_ud/` |
| Multi-Word Token (MWT, ID `N-M`) | `de_ud/` |
| Empty Nodes (ID `N.M`) | `en_ud/` |
| Comment lines (`# sent_id`, `# annotator` …) | all directories |
| `__cols__` (N arbitrary label columns) | `ner/`, `custom/`, `morph/`, `de_ud/`, `en_ud/` |
| `__dep_cols__` (N dependency layers) | `srl/`, `morph/`, `de_ud/`, `en_ud/` |
| Per-project tagset | all directories with `tagset.json` |
| Auto-project assignment (different sentence counts) | mix files from different directories |

### Loading the Demos

1. **Tagset first**: load `tagset.json` from a directory via "📤 Upload tagset" or drag & drop
2. **Then the CoNLL-U files**: all `annotator_*.conllu` from the same directory via "Add files"
3. Alternatively: **all files at once** via drag & drop — the tool detects type and order automatically

---

## Limitations

- **Multi-word tokens** (IDs `N-M`) and **empty nodes** (IDs `N.M`) are stored on load and fully reconstructed on CoNLL-U export; only regular tokens appear in the comparison table and tree view
- At least **two files** are required for comparison and tree view
- Data lives only in **browser memory** — use session export to save your progress permanently
